# Multi_Asset_Portfolio_Optimization
This project enhances portfolio optimization using robust covariance estimation and a rolling window approach for dynamic asset allocation. It compares optimized portfolios with a naive 1/N portfolio, demonstrating superior risk-adjusted returns achieved through robust techniques and dynamic rebalancing.
